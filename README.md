# Micrograd in Rust 🦀
A Rust implementation of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd - a tiny autograd engine and neural network library.



This is micrograd by Andrej in Rust (wanted to build the intuition, not just code while watching him). 
With Rust it wasn't that easy compared to Python, so it was my first project in machine learning and first time using Rust for this kind of project. 
Even though I have experience in Rust, building something from scratch like this was my first time. 
That's it "peace"
